comments in piece & piece subclasses
change (void)isCapture (see bishop.cpp)

isMoveLegal() is only called by hasValidMoves()
hasValidMoves() checks all possible destination squares
we can restrict the search space by returning
a vector of positions

use getMoveDirections to iterate across each specific
direction a piece can legally move in
until it hits an allied piece
or until (and including) it hits an enemy piece
make it more polymorphic?

change validMoveDir to just use absFileDiff

if pawn is not on home row, it's moved.
