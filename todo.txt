isMoveLegal() is only called by hasValidMoves()
hasValidMoves() checks all possible destination squares
we can restrict the search space by returning
a vector of positions

use getMoveDirections to iterate across each specific
direction a piece can legally move in
until it hits an allied piece
or until (and including) it hits an enemy piece
make it more polymorphic?
